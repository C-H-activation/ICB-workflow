# Examples from the manuscript

In order to examplify the application of the SoBo model, we take examples as shown in the [manuscript](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6362ce5aaca1981770efe240/original/a-hybrid-machine-learning-approach-to-predict-the-iridium-catalyzed-borylation-of-c-h-bonds.pdf) (Fig. 5) and run those compounds with the current implementation:

| ID  | SMILES                                             |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | CSc1nc(ccc1C#N)c2ccc(Cl)cc2                        |
| 2   | COc1cc(NC(c2c[n]c(F)cc2)=O)ccc1                    |
| 3   | Cc1cc(Nc2ccn(n2)c3ccccc3)cc(C)c1OC(=O)OC(C)(C)C    |
| 4   | COc1cc(C2SCCCS2)c(cc1OC)C(=O)c3ccc4OCOc4c3         |
| 5   | COc1nc(C)cnc1NS(=O)(=O)c2cccnc2c3ccc(CC(C)(C)C)cc3 |
| 6   | O=C(Oc1ccc2C(=O)COc2c1)c3cccs3                     |

Results of predictions are given as `csv` and `svg` files.
For the system with `ID = 1` the total computation time was 8 minutes and 45 seconds on a single CPU (Macbook Pro 1,4 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5, 16GB RAM).

## Run a SoBo prediction

After creating a proper Python virtual environment and installing the SoBo model, predictions are obtained as follows, where `SMILES` represents the SMILES string and `NAME` represents the directory in which the predictions will be placed.

```bash
> sobo --smiles <SMILES> --name <NAME>
```

In order to see all possible command-line flags run:

```bash
> sobo --help
```
